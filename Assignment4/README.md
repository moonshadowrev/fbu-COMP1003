# Matrix Operations in C

This guide explains how to create a C project for performing various matrix operations. The project includes a header file, a source file for the operation definitions, and a main file for demonstration.

## Files Structure

1. **matrix_operations.h**: Header file for matrix operation functions.
2. **matrix_operations.c**: Source file for function definitions.
3. **Question.c**: Main file to demonstrate the usage.
4. **Makefile**: Simplifies the compilation process.

## Compilation and Running

To compile the project, use the command:

```bash
make
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./matrix_program
```

To clean up the compiled files:

```bash
make clean
```
